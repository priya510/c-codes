Encapsulation

	Hide your memeber variables and access them through public
	functions for different reasons.

	Getters & Setters functions
		OR
	Accessors and Mutators functions
	
Access Specifiers:
        1) private (Bydefault all variables and functions in c++ are private)
        2) public
        3) protected

Constructor
	Constructor is used to constructor memory of a class
	and intialize member variables.

	There are two type of constructors:
		1) Default Constructor
		2) Parameterized Constructor

	There are following rules to create constructor:
		1) Constructor and class name should be same.
		2) Constructor don't have any return type.
		3) Constructor invokes automatically when we create
		   object of a class. We don't have to call them
		   explicitly like a function.


Destructor:
		
	Whenever we use class. At the end of program all the memories
	destroyed by destructor to clean the garbage collection as
	they are not required in the system. Because in every execution of 
	a program. Program creates a new memeory for a class.

	To create destructor use tilde sign and same name as a class
	name.	
	Only one destructor per class is allowed and it will delete
	all memories created by different constructors.

Structure:

	Structure is similar like class but there are many OOPS
	Concept which struct doesn't support.
